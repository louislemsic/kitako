## 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

### 1.1. Personal information you disclose to us

**In Short:** We don't collect any personal information. All your data stays on your device.

Kitako is designed with privacy as its core principle. We do not collect, store, or process any personal information on our servers. When you use Kitako, all your data—including expenses, accounts, categories, and any other information you enter—is stored exclusively on your device using your browser's IndexedDB storage.

**What data is stored locally?** The following information is stored on your device only:
- Account names and types (savings, credit card, e-wallet, etc.)
- Account balances and initial amounts
- Transaction records (expenses, income, transfers)
- Category names and configurations
- Application settings and preferences

**Sensitive Information.** All financial data you enter into Kitako is stored locally on your device. We never have access to this information, and it never leaves your browser.

**Payment Data.** Kitako does not process payments or collect payment information. The application is a tracking tool only—you enter your financial data manually.

**Social Media Login Data.** Kitako does not require or support social media logins. There are no user accounts, sign-ups, or authentication systems.

**Application Data.** Since Kitako runs entirely in your browser, any data you enter is stored locally. We do not collect device information, location data, or any other application data.

All data that you enter into Kitako remains on your device and is never transmitted to any server.

### 1.2. Information automatically collected

**In Short:** We don't automatically collect any information. Everything happens locally in your browser.

Kitako does not automatically collect any information. Since the application runs entirely in your browser without server-side components, there is no mechanism for automatic data collection. Your browser may collect standard technical information (like IP addresses) when you initially load the application, but this is standard web behavior and is not used by Kitako for any purpose.

We do not use cookies, tracking technologies, or analytics tools that collect your personal information. The application code is open-source, so you can verify this for yourself.

### 1.3. Third-Party Services

**In Short:** We don't use third-party services that collect your data.

Kitako does not integrate with third-party services that would collect your personal information. The application is self-contained and operates entirely within your browser.

## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** We don't process your information. All processing happens locally on your device.

Since Kitako runs entirely in your browser and we never receive your data, we do not process your information in any way. All data processing—such as calculating balances, filtering transactions, or generating reports—happens locally on your device using JavaScript running in your browser.

**We do not process your personal information for any of the following reasons because we never have access to it:**
- We don't facilitate account creation (there are no accounts)
- We don't track usage or analytics
- We don't send communications
- We don't provide support services that require your data
- We don't improve services based on your data (since we don't have it)
- We don't comply with legal obligations regarding your data (since we don't have it)

All functionality of Kitako operates entirely on your device using the data you've stored locally.

## 3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

**In Short:** We never share your personal information because we never collect it.

Kitako does not share your personal information with anyone because we never collect it in the first place. Your data never leaves your device, so there is no data to share.

**We do not share information with:**
- Vendors or service providers (we don't have any)
- Business partners (we don't have any)
- Advertisers (we don't have any)
- Analytics providers (we don't use any)
- Social media platforms (we don't integrate with any)
- Government or law enforcement (we have no data to provide)

Your data is yours alone, stored on your device, and never transmitted anywhere.

## 4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

**In Short:** No. We don't use cookies or tracking technologies.

Kitako does not use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or any other tracking technologies. Since the application runs entirely in your browser and doesn't require server-side functionality, there's no need for tracking technologies.

The application may use browser localStorage or sessionStorage for technical purposes (like remembering your theme preference), but this data never leaves your device and is not used for tracking or analytics.

## 5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?

**In Short:** We don't. Kitako doesn't use social logins or any authentication system.

Kitako does not require user accounts, sign-ups, or authentication. There are no social media logins, email logins, or any other form of user authentication. You simply open the application in your browser and start using it. All your data is stored locally on your device.

## 6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** We don't keep your information at all. You control how long your data is stored on your device.

Since Kitako doesn't collect or store your information on any servers, we don't keep your data for any period of time. Your data is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB, and you have complete control over it.

You can delete your data at any time using the application's built-in deletion feature. Once deleted, the data is permanently removed from your device's IndexedDB storage. We have no copies of your data because we never received it in the first place.

## 7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

**In Short:** Your data is stored locally on your device, protected by your browser's security mechanisms.

Since Kitako stores all data locally on your device using IndexedDB, your data is protected by:
- Your browser's built-in security features
- Your device's operating system security
- Your device's physical security (locks, encryption, etc.)

**Important considerations:**
- Your data is only as secure as your device. If someone has physical access to your device and can access your browser, they may be able to see your data.
- If you clear your browser data or uninstall the application, your data will be deleted.
- Browser-based storage is generally secure, but you should keep your device secure and use appropriate security measures (passwords, encryption, etc.).

We cannot guarantee 100% security because we don't control your device or browser. However, since your data never leaves your device, it's not vulnerable to server-side breaches or data leaks from our systems (because we don't have any).

## 8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

**In Short:** We don't collect information from anyone, including minors.

Kitako does not collect information from anyone, regardless of age. Since all data is stored locally on the user's device and we never receive any data, there are no age restrictions or parental consent requirements from a data collection perspective.

However, users should be aware that financial tracking applications may not be appropriate for minors, and parents should supervise their children's use of such applications.

## 9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

**In Short:** You have complete control over your data. You can view, modify, or delete it at any time.

Since Kitako doesn't collect or store your data on any servers, you have complete control over your information:

**Access:** You can view all your data directly in the application at any time.

**Modification:** You can edit, update, or modify any of your data directly in the application.

**Deletion:** You can delete all your data at any time using the application's built-in deletion feature. Once deleted, the data is permanently removed from your device.

**Portability:** Since your data is stored locally in IndexedDB, you can export it (if the application provides export functionality) or access it directly through your browser's developer tools.

**No need to contact us:** Since we don't have your data, there's no need to request access, modification, or deletion from us. You control everything directly through the application.

## 10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

**In Short:** Do-Not-Track settings don't apply because we don't track anything.

Kitako doesn't use any tracking technologies, so Do-Not-Track (DNT) browser settings don't apply. We don't track your browsing activities, usage patterns, or any other information because we don't have the capability to do so—the application runs entirely in your browser without server-side tracking.

## 11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?

**In Short:** Yes, we may update this notice as necessary, but our core privacy principles will not change.

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time to reflect changes in the application or to clarify our practices. However, our core commitment to privacy will not change: Kitako will always be a browser-only application that stores data locally and never collects information on servers.

If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will update the "Last updated" date. Since we don't have a way to notify users directly (we don't have user accounts or contact information), you should periodically review this notice when you use the application.

## 12. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?

If you have questions or comments about this notice, you can reach out to us through our open-source repository. Since Kitako is an open-source project, you can:

- Review the source code to verify our privacy claims
- Submit issues or questions through the project's GitHub repository
- Contribute improvements to enhance privacy features

**Kitako is an open-source project.** You can verify our privacy practices by examining the source code, which is publicly available.

## 13. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?

**In Short:** We don't collect data from you, so there's nothing to review, update, or delete on our end.

Since Kitako doesn't collect or store your data on any servers, there's no data to request from us. All your data is stored locally on your device, and you can:

- **Review your data:** Open the application and view all your information
- **Update your data:** Edit any information directly in the application
- **Delete your data:** Use the application's built-in deletion feature to permanently remove all data from your device

If you have questions about how to use these features, you can refer to the application's documentation or the open-source code.

## 14. OPEN-SOURCE COMMITMENT

**In Short:** Kitako is open-source, so you can verify our privacy practices yourself.

Kitako is an open-source expense tracker. This means:
- The source code is publicly available for review
- You can verify that we don't collect or transmit your data
- You can see exactly how your data is stored locally
- You can contribute improvements to enhance privacy
- You can fork the project and run your own version if desired

Our commitment to privacy is not just a promise—it's verifiable through our open-source code.
