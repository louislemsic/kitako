## Why Kitako?

I created Kitako because I was frustrated with the many finance apps out there that charge subscription fees or require payment to access basic features. I wanted something simple—just a tool to track my expenses without the complexity and cost.

### Simple Expense Tracking

Kitako focuses on one thing: helping you track your expenses. No complicated features, no upsells, no premium tiers. Just a clean, straightforward way to see where your money goes.

### Your Data, Your Ownership

Most finance apps store your data on their servers, which means they have access to your financial information. Kitako is different. All your data stays on your device, stored locally in your browser. You own it completely, and it never leaves your device.

### No Hidden Costs

Kitako is completely free and open-source. There are no subscription fees, no premium features locked behind paywalls, and no ads. What you see is what you get—a simple, privacy-first expense tracker that respects both your wallet and your privacy.

### Open Source & Transparent

Since Kitako is open-source, you can review the code, verify our privacy claims, and even contribute improvements. Our commitment to privacy isn't just a promise—it's verifiable through our code.
