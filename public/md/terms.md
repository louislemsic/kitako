## AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS

**Kitako** ("Company," "we," "us," "our") is an open-source, privacy-first expense tracker application that runs entirely in your browser.

We operate the web application Kitako (the "Application" or "App"), as well as any related services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the "Services").

The Application provides users with tools to track expenses, manage accounts, and monitor their financial activity—all stored locally on their device with no server-side data storage.

Kitako is an open-source project. You can review the source code, verify our privacy claims, and contribute improvements through our public repository.

These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and Kitako, concerning your access to and use of the Services.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.

The Services are intended for users who want to track their personal expenses and manage their finances. The Services are not intended for users under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

We recommend that you print a copy of these Legal Terms for your records.
